      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always enjoyed creating a custom UI for games and other applications. Often, I would spend more time customizing instead of playing the actual games. Also, I would like to learn how to update/change applications. There are far too many times where IT has said something cannot be done when it only involves moving information. I am determined to learn how to do it myself.</p>
